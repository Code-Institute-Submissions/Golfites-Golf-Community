        <p>Our goal at Golfites is to provide Irish Golfers with an online community where they can connect with fellow golfers. Think of us as golfing social community similar to Facebook.</p>
            <p>The Golfites idea came when we realised that there wasn't an online resource for golfers and specifically Irish golfers to come together in a golf specific group to connect and learn from each other. As golfers ourselves we realise that golf can be a very individualistic sport and that connecting with and learning from other golfers is an important aspect in improving our golf games. </p>

            <p>Golfites members can avail of a number of our built-in resources which are aimed at providing the golfer with a unique online experience. We are like a one stop shop for all things golf related.<hr><strong>Below are the features available to Golfites Members:</strong></p>
